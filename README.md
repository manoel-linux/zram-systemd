# GITLAB

- Migration to GitLab

- Hello, dear visitor! This repository used to reside here on GitHub, but we have now migrated to GitLab. We want to explain why we made this change and how you can access our updated project.
Reason for the Migration

- The main reason for our move to GitLab is the issue with two-factor authentication (2FA). Since we don't have a cell phone, we couldn't activate 2FA on GitHub, which posed a security challenge for our account. Furthermore, the program you found here on GitHub might be outdated, as we now maintain the most recent version on GitLab.
Access Our Project on GitLab

- You can find the latest version of our program on GitLab. To access it, simply follow this link: https://gitlab.com/manoel-linux1

- Access the Project on GitLab

- On GitLab, you'll find all the latest updates, bug fixes, and improvements we've made to the project. Feel free to explore, contribute, and report issues directly on GitLab.

- We appreciate your understanding and ongoing support. We hope you enjoy our initiative on GitLab, and it serves you as well as it did here.
